* What is Psychometrics?

- Study of mental processes
- Operationalised using questionnaires and other instruments
- Mostly questionnaires :/

* Theory

- Two major theories:
  - Classical test Theory
  - Item response theory (modern test theory)

* CTT

- CTT is normally associated with a set of methods
  - Factor analysis (PCA on shared variance between items, potentially incorporating correlations between factors)
  - item reliabilities (how consistent is each question with the overall scale)

* CTT True Score

- If you could get a human and make them respond to a questionnaire many times, while removing their memory after each time
- The average score on the questionnaire would be the true score
- This experiment is clearly impossible, but that never stopped anyone

* Factor Analysis/IQ and *g*

- Much of the original work concerned intelligence, and more specifically IQ
- Stanford-Binet test focus of much early attention
- Factor analysis was used on the correlation matrix of responses to the test
- A number (chosen by the analyst) of factors are used, and can be rotated either orthogonally or obliquely
- This matrix of coefficients is then analysed to find _simple structure_

* Simple Structure

- Principle is that each item should load on one and only one factor
- If there are n factors, each item should have a 1 in one column and zeros in the other
- This never actually happens

* Problems

- This is a method of unsupervised learning.
- Easier for intelligence, where we have a correct answer
- Method also applied to personality questionnaires, where there is no "right answer".
- I spent my PhD trying to figure out how to do this
- I did not succeed :(

* Example

- Famous model in psychology, the Big 5 personality traits
- Theory states that these are sufficient and independent for an understanding of personality
- Came from Costa and McCrae in the 70's
- data available in R
* Big 5
- Extraversion: socially outgoing or not
- Conscientiousness: responsible or not
- Openness: neophilia or neophobia?
- Neuroticism: worrier or not?
- Agreeableness:

* R Code
#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results none :exports code
  require(psych)
  neo <- data(neo) #this does not work
  data(neo) ##this does, wtf?
#+END_SRC
- Correlation matrix of responses to questions
- 6 questions for each of the five factors
